# Module 1: Kickstarting with Excel

Louise is a young playwrighter whose play *Fever* is close to meet its fundraising goal in a short period of time. She is very excited about how her play funding is going but now, she wants to gather more information to understand better how different parameters impact the campaigns outcomes.

## Overview of Project

In this project, crowdfunding data is analyzed in order to find how fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose

The goal of this analysis is to convey insights about the impact that the launch date of campaigns and/or their financial goals have in the process to fullfill the finantiation of the playwritings.

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis of the crowdfinding data is performed in two ways:

* How the campaigns do based on the Launch Date: 
* How the campaigns do based on the Financial Goal

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Figure 1. shows how successful campaigns are based on the Launch date ![LaunchDate](/Users/leidydorado/Documents/RDS_Bootcamp2021/CrowdFundingAnalysis-Module1/Challenge-Module1/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

* What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

* What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

* What are some limitations of this dataset?

* What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
